# simple_volcano_map

A simple Plotly map of Holocene volcanic eruptions. Inspired by the neat work on visualizations of A. Geller.

It's interactive, if you download the .html file.

Extensions to this include

1. Adding Pleistocene?
2. Adding eruptions of unknown ages.
3. Making the plot more interactive.
4. Incorporating VEI data and additional eruption data.

Figuring out how to make it an app. Or something like that.
